          <p>I’ve been going to football games with friends this year which has been fun. I’ve also been dancing a lot, and I’m really excited to play the Snow Queen in The Nutcracker. I’m also super excited for the regular dance competition season and hopefully being able to dance on stage without masks this year.

          I’m still figuring out where I'm going to go to college. I’m thinking I’ll probably major in computer science or some type of engineering because I like creating things and finding solutions, I just haven't decided which one yet. I’m excited to go to college, and if I stay in state I’ll probably go somewhere in the Twin Cities which will be nice because I'll be close to my sister. But I’m also kinda sad to move out and not live with my twin anymore.</p>

          <p>So far the school year has been going well, and I am surprised by how little homework I have each night. I’m just hoping that school stays in person for the whole year. I’m also hoping that all the other non-academic activities are able to happen this year because I really missed them last year.</p>
