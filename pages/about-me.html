          <p>Outside of school I enjoy crocheting, knitting, reading, listening to music, and playing guitar. I also spend a lot of time dancing. I have been dancing since I was three years old. My favorite styles of dance are ballet, pointe, and kickline. I dance competitively in the spring and also participate in my studio’s production of the Nutcracker during the winter.</p>

          <p>Hi, my name is Erin De Witt. I'm a current senior at Rosemount High School. Next year I'm planning on majoring in something STEM, likely computer science, engineering, or math and possibly minoring in Spanish. I have been a member of the math team here at RHS for the last four years. I’m also a member of both the National Honor Society and the National Spanish Honor Society.</p>
